## Features

**Languages:** English

**Accessibility:** Colour-blindness, hearing impairment

**Modalities:** fMRI, EEG

**Devices:** Computer

**Species:** Homo sapiens

## Development

**Software:** NBS Presentation version 17

**Requirements:** 2-button response box or mouse/keyboard required

## Administration
Run this task using NBS Presentation.

## Procedure and Conditions
This task includes an experimental session (40 trials) for either fMRI or EEG/offline use. The stimuli are randomized so a practice session can be run using the EEG/offline for any modality and may be ended prematurely once the participant has understood the task. Each trial displays a string of consonants (4 or 6 letters) followed by a delay (4 seconds), followed by a probe letter. Participants responded with one or the other button to indicate (yes/no) whether the probe was presented in the previous string. Inter-trial intervals are jittered between 2 and 12 seconds.

## Output Files
Log files are output to calculate event timing.

## Scoring
- number of correct responses
- reaction time
